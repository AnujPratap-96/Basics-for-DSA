## Overview

This repository contains basic C++ programs for solving number-based problems. These codes are a great starting point for beginners who are learning about loops, conditionals, and basic mathematical operations in C++. The focus is on understanding the logic and building problem-solving skills in DSA.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd repo-name
    ```
3. Compile any of the C++ files using the g++ compiler:
    ```bash
    g++ filename.cpp -o outputfile
    ```
4. Run the compiled code:
    ```bash
    ./outputfile
    ```

## Programs Included

The repository includes the following programs:

1. **Count Digits in a Number**  
   A program to count the total number of digits in a given integer.

2. **Reverse a Number**  
   A program to reverse the digits of a given number.

3. **Check Palindrome Number**  
   A program to check whether a given number is a palindrome or not.

4. **Divisors of a Number**  
   A program to find and print all divisors of a given number.

5. **Prime Number Check**  
   A program to check if a number is prime.

6. **Prime Factors of a Number**  
   A program to find all the prime factors of a number.

7. **GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)**  
   A program to calculate the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

8. **Smallest Prime Factor of a Number**  
   A program to find the smallest prime factor of a number.

9. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**  
   A program to generate all prime numbers up to a given limit using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.

10. **Armstrong Number**  
    A program to check if a number is an Armstrong number.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the folder where the required program is located.
2. Compile the file using `g++` or any other C++ compiler.
3. Run the executable file generated after compilation.

For example, to run the *GCD Program*:
```bash
g++ gcd.cpp -o gcd
./gcd
```
